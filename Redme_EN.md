# Git & GitHub — From Zero to Advanced  
### A Practical, Step-by-Step Persian Learning Repository

This repository is a **fully hands-on course** to learn **Git** and **GitHub** — from installation and setup to professional branching, resolving merge conflicts, working with `rebase`, signing commits, hooks, and even **CI/CD with GitHub Actions**.  
The goal: help learners with **no prior experience in Git** reach a professional level, step by step.

---

## 👥 Who Is This For?
- 🧩 **Beginners:** Get started from zero — first project, first commit, first push  
- ⚙️ **Intermediate Developers:** Learn branching, pull requests, rebase, stash, reset/revert  
- 🧑‍💻 **Teams:** Understand clean workflows, branch rules, and lightweight CI/CD pipelines  

---

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn
- Installing Git on Windows, macOS, and Linux  
- Basic configuration (`user.name`, `user.email`)  
- Creating an **SSH key** and securely connecting to GitHub  
- Core workflow: `status → add → commit → push → pull`  
- Professional **branching**: create/switch, `merge`, `rebase`, and resolving conflicts  
- History & debugging: `log`, `diff`, `blame`, `bisect`, `reflog`  
- Version control with `tag`  
- Key files: `.gitignore`, **Git LFS**, **submodules**  
- Commit signing (GPG/SSH) and local **hooks (pre-commit)**  
- Introduction to **GitHub Actions** for simple CI pipelines  

---

## 🧰 Requirements
- A computer with terminal or PowerShell access  
- A GitHub account  

> No terminal experience? Don’t worry — every lesson includes commands explained in simple language with real-world examples.
